# Codes used for Bionano scaffolding (de novo)
Acquired Bionano optical maps sequencing datasets were first filtered using length cutoff as 150
Kb and were used to derive Bionano de novo genome assembly. We used Canu-assembly as the
reference genome to guide de novo genome assembly and generated the “.cmap” file with length
cutoff as 20 Kb and at least five restriction digestion sites.
