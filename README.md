# Codes used for Ophiorrhiza pumila genome and metabolome project
# Abstract
Plant genome assemblies remain highly fragmented with hundreds to thousands of assembly gaps. Here we present an ordered multi-scaffolding combined with experimental validation as an approach to achieve chromosome-level genome assembly of Ophiorrhiza pumila, a camptothecin producing medicinal plant. With 21 assembly gaps and contig N50 18.49 Mb, the Ophiorrhiza genome is among the best plant genomes assembled to date. We also identified 273 nitrogen-containing metabolites, including diverse monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) in O. pumila. Integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics datasets identified gene-to-metabolite networks associated with MIA biosynthesis. Comparative genomics identified biogenesis of strictosidine as the origin of MIAs evolution. The emergence of enzymes catalyzing strictosidine biosynthesis preceded the evolution of downstream enzymes post-Î³ whole-genome-triplication event, which occurred around 110 million years ago in O. pumila and before the whole genome duplication in Camptotheca acuminata genome identified in this study. Combining comparative genomics, synteny, and metabolic gene-cluster analysis, we proposed a working model for MIAs evolution and a pan-genome for MIA biosynthesis. The resources established in this study will be key for deriving a sustainable supply of camptothecin.


In this github database, we have provided all codes that were used for creating genome assembly of Ophiorrhiza pumila, and for omics analysis. Informations on Raw data, basic R codes and statistical analysis performed are provided through supplementary files, data availibity statement and method section.
